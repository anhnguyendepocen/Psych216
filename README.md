Psych 216A: Statistics and data analysis in Python
==================================================

A translation of the Psych216 homeworks from MATLAB to Python.

The class website with lecture videos and notes can be found [here](http://white.stanford.edu/~knk/Psych216A/).

The tutorials are written in the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html).

Note, you will need the seaborn package that is also availible in my github. Otherwise,
things should probably work on a standard EPD install (but maybe not?)
