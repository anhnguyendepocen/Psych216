Psych 216A: Statistics and data analysis in Python
==================================================

A translation of the Psych216 homeworks from MATLAB to Python.

The class website with lecture videos and notes can be found [here](http://white.stanford.edu/~knk/Psych216A/).

The tutorials are written in the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html).
They were written using the development version, and might not work on a stable release. Fortunately, IPython 0.13 (currently in beta) will most likely be released by the time there is much content here.

Note, you will need the seaborn package that is also availible in my github. Otherwise,
things should probably work on a standard EPD install (but maybe not?)
